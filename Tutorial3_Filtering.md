# Tutorial 3: Filtering ANGSD genotype likelihoods

## Goal: 

Assess missingness, depth, and quality of genotype likelihoods and filter for 1) low missingness, 2) even missingness


## Steps: 

1. Assess and filter for individual depth

2. Assess and filter for depth across loci

3. Filter for individual missingness

4. Filter for missingness across loci

5. Assess sequencing quality

6. Assess HWE
