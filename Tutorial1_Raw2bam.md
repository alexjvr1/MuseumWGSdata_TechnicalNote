# Tutorial 1: Raw data to cleaned bam files 



## Goals: 

1. Process raw fastq files to cleaned bam files for variant calling or ANGSD analysis

2. Additional processing of museum samples to correct for post-mortem sequence degradation

3. Assess differences in depth between datasets and decide wether to downsample to the same depth


## Steps

1. Demultiplex and remove adapter 

2. Clean museum data
  
  2.1 Repair sequences with bbRepair
  
  2.2 Repair sequences with MapDamage

3. Index and prepare data for variant calling

4. Assess depth and optional downsampling to equal depths
